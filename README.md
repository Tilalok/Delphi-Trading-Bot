This Pine Script code establishes an advanced trading bot with heightened security measures. Utilizing the TradingView platform, the script incorporates key technical indicators such as Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) to formulate trading decisions. To safeguard sensitive information, API keys are stored using secure input fields, preventing exposure in shared code. The strategy incorporates risk management principles, including position sizing, risk-reward ratios, and drawdown management. The code systematically executes buy and sell orders based on conditions met by the indicators, with position limits enforced. It also calculates drawdown percentages and dynamically adjusts position sizes during drawdown periods. Historical data from Binance, fetched through TradingView, is used for analysis and plotting. With these components, the script offers a comprehensive approach to algorithmic trading while prioritizing the security of sensitive data and effective risk management. Testing before live deployment is paramount.
